Python solutions to problems listed in the infamous "Blind 75" list of problems.

The Blind 75 is a list of questions most likely to appear in technical interviews, curated by a Facebook Tech Lead. 
The solutions contained in this git will value legibility, cleanliness, and ease of memorization over run and space time efficiency.
The solutions are directly taken from my leetcode account, and will therefore use the same parameter names as leetcode does.
Solutions will be sorted by (what I believe to be) order of importance of category.

Maybe when I am done with this, I will work on sean prashad's 171 questions. Who knows.
